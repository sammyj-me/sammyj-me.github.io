--FEA ANALYSIS
#### About
- 
#### Skills Involved
- Electronics Engineering: A strong understanding of electronics is vital. This includes knowledge of circuit design, components like sensors, transistors, capacitors, and resistors, as well as digital electronics concepts such as microcontrollers and logic gates.
- Sensor Technology: Knowing how to select, incorporate, and interpret data from sensors is critical in a telemetry device. This could include accelerometers, gyroscopes, or GPS modules for tracking movement and speed.
- Embedded Systems Programming: A sprinting telemetry device would likely involve an embedded system. Being able to program these systems, typically using languages like C or C++, is a crucial skill.
- Wireless Communication: The device needs to transmit the collected data, requiring knowledge in wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or potentially cellular communication.
- Signal Processing: Raw data from sensors often needs to be processed and filtered to be useful. This requires an understanding of signal processing techniques.
- Data Analysis and Interpretation: Once the data is gathered, it needs to be analyzed and interpreted. This could involve statistical techniques, and even machine learning, depending on the complexity of the device.
- Battery Management: Given that the device is likely to be portable, understanding how to manage power consumption for optimal battery life is an important skill.
- Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design: The device needs to be designed to be durable, lightweight, and comfortable for the user. This involves knowledge of materials, ergonomics, and design principles.
- Software Development: For data visualization or interfacing with the device, a software application might be needed. This could involve coding in languages such as Python or Java, and knowledge of user interface and user experience design.
- Prototyping and Testing: Rapid prototyping skills such as using a breadboard for electronic components or 3D printing for casing can speed up the development process. In addition, being able to thoroughly test and debug both hardware and software is a key skill.
