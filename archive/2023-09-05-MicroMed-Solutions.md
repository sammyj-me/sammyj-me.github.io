### About
At MicroMed Solutions I was a Process Development Engineer responsible for converting laminate materials to microfluidic devices in a contract manufacturing environment.

#### Skills Involved
- Mechanical Engineering
- Process Development
- Laser Ablation
- Customer Facing Role.

- Work directly with customers to develop new diagnostic products utilizing the technical
tools for material converting, chemistry dispensing and assembly of MicroMed Solutions.
    - 

- Work with quality to define critical to quality requirements for new and existing
programs.
    - Scope Identification: Understand the program objectives. Are you focused on high precision, speed, or other key attributes?

    - FMEA Analysis: Use Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to identify potential failure points that could impact quality.

    - Voice of the Customer (VOC): Gather customer specifications and tolerances. Translate these into measurable parameters.

    - Process Mapping: Create a detailed Process Flow Diagram (PFD) or Value Stream Map (VSM) to understand the manufacturing steps.

    - Critical Parameter Identification: Work with quality teams to identify the critical parameters affecting CTQs. Use SPC (Statistical Process Control) methods to set upper and lower control limits.

    - Gage R&R: Conduct a Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility study to ensure measurement systems are reliable.

    - Control Plans & SOPs: Develop control plans and Standard Operating Procedures. Make sure they align with CTQs.

    - Pilot Testing: Run small-scale tests to validate the process. Revise CTQs if needed.

    - CAPA Plans: Set up Corrective And Preventive Action plans for deviations from CTQs.

    - Documentation: Record all CTQ parameters, test results, and process adjustments for traceability.

    - Continuous Monitoring: Use real-time monitoring tools like Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) to maintain quality.

- Develop work instructions for development and production programs.
    Development Phase:
        Requirements Gathering: Understand objectives, tolerances, and specs from engineering and quality teams.

        Preliminary Draft: Create an initial WI draft incorporating engineering drawings, CAD models, or prototypes.

        Peer Review: Get feedback from development engineers and process planners.

        Revise: Incorporate changes, emphasizing clarity and accuracy.

    Transition to Production:
        Pilot Run: Implement the WIs in a pilot production run. Monitor for bottlenecks and deviations.

        Data Collection: Collect metrics like cycle time, First Pass Yield, and defect rates.

        Adjustments: Revise WIs based on production outcomes and feedback.

    Collaboration with Production Staff:
        On-floor Assessment: Spend time on the production floor to understand the workflow and identify gaps in the initial WIs.

        Staff Input: Consult with machine operators and line workers. Their hands-on experience is invaluable for optimizing WIs.

        Training: Conduct formal training sessions to familiarize staff with the new WIs.

        Validation: Have staff perform tasks under the new WIs to validate their effectiveness.

        Feedback Loop: Create a system for ongoing feedback from production staff for continuous improvement.

    Finalization:
        Documentation: Finalize the WIs, complete with diagrams, pictures, or even QR codes linking to video demos.

        Controlled Release: Use a document management system to ensure only the latest WIs are in circulation.

    Continuous Improvement:
        KPI Monitoring: Use key performance indicators to evaluate WI effectiveness over time.

        Regular Reviews: Conduct periodic audits and reviews with production and quality staff to update WIs as needed.

- Work with production personnel to transfer process knowledge for new programs.
    - 

- Design tooling and fixtures to improve productivity, quality, safety, and/or ergonomics.
    - 
- Assist in the specification, purchase, and implementation of new production equipment.
    - 
- Assist quality in developing and maintaining the MicroMed Solutions Quality
Management System.

- Communicate progress of projects to Engineering Manager.


- Attend meetings as directed by management.
    - 

- Attend seminars and trade shows as requested by management.
    - 

- Assist and support all areas of MicroMed Solutions as needed.
    - 

- Continuously strive to improve personal and group performance.
    - 

- Demonstrated experience in process development.
    - 


- Attention to detail and strong blueprint reading and comprehension.
    - 

- Ability to represent MicroMed Solutions in a professional manner to prospective and
current customers.
    - 

- Demonstrate excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to formulate, execute, and
document process concepts and plans.
    - 

- Experience in operating in an ISO 13485 controlled environment.
    - 


- Knowledge of computer controlled machinery and processes used in manufacturing and
ability to use AutoCAD or related programs.
    - Utilized AutoCAD to design DXF files
    - Utilized SolidWorks to visualize part stack ups and build new fixtures for production

- Good communication skills – oral and written.


- Extensive standing and walking on concrete floors in a manufacturing environment.


- Experience with metrology equipment and use of SPC tools.
    - https://www.slideshare.net/MadeleineLee/statistical-process-control-spc-tools-7-basic-tools
    - Utilized a microvu system to perform metrology
    - Performed statistical analysis with SPC tools to determine features that were in/out of tolerance
    - With the lasers we had it was difficult to hold tolerances on the outer sides of parts because of how the scanner was set up.

##### Process
- What did the daily routine look like? 
    - Arrived between 6AM to 8AM depending on prior days/flow of product
    - 8AM standup meeting
    - 8AM - 12PM Job Duty Block
    - 12PM - 1PM Lunch
    - 1PM - 5PM Job Duty Block

    - Job Duty Blocks were spent:
        - Setting up new jobs on laser ablation machines
        - Designed laser ablation programs
        - Experimented with laminate structure stackups
        - Interfacing with qualified customers for status updates
        - Process capability studies
        
- What kind of companies did you interact with?
    - Interfaced with garage-startups to multi-million dollar companies.
- What did the process of designing and manufacturing devices look like?
    - Used AutoCAD
- Was there on-job mentorship?
- Did I manage/mentor anyone?
    - Managed Assemblers, Laser processing technicians
- Do I have a reason for every element of how the facility operated?
