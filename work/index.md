- Designed tooling and fixtures and adjacent work instructions for a microfluidic device assembly processes.

**The University of Saint Thomas**, Undergraduate Research Assistant, Spring 2020 [View Presentation Board](\edu\InquiryPoster.PNG){:target="_blank" class="button ilabel pink-block"}

{:.list-plus}
- Performed image analysis using MATLAB PIV to measure axial and radial velocities of an effervescent jet flow downstream from the inlet for various trials of differing bubble sizes and gas-to-liquid ratios.
- In this experiment, it was found that radial (u) flow activity was essentially constant and that as measurements trend further away from the jet nozzle, axial (v) velocities become more widely distributed.



**The University of Saint Thomas**, Undergraduate Research Assistant, Spring 2020

{:.list-plus}
- Performed preliminary reasearch on tow tanks for the early stages of development to measure hull drag without a tow tank.
- Researched and documented existing US University and private sector tow tank specifications including strain gauge configurations and structural designs.

**Rochester Swim Club**, Assistant Swim Coach, Summer 2018

{:.list-plus}
- Assisted with periodization-related training decisions by writing workouts for specifc training phases.
- Gave specific form cues to +80 athletes during training.
- Briefed and debriefed athletes on specific strategy and performance before and after races.


## Leadership {#leadership}

**Earth Day Innovate-a-thon**, Greenies (2nd Place Finish), May 2019 [Story](https://news.stthomas.edu/earth-day-innovate-a-thon-creates-sustainable-ideas){:target="_blank" class="button ilabel pink-block"}

{:.list-plus}
- Competed in a 24-hour-hackathon style event creating a sustainable solution to pitch to potential "investors".
- The concept of Greenies was to track energy usage analytics of dorm floors and incentivize students to reduce their energy consumption by rewarding winning floors on a monthly basis.
- The goal was to create an initiative to raise enviornmental awareness and encourage community through the common goal of saving energy, benefitting both the enviornment and the pockets of the university.
