### About
<img src="/media/Terrier-Media/use.png" style="max-width: 400px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom:20px;">
The Aperto Terrier is a consumer electronic device designed for measuring sprinting and linear velocity analysis. Athletes essentially unreel a spool that is measured by a rotary encoder, capturing their linear motion. Signal processing techniques extract over 18 running metrics including splits, max speed and more.

With a user-friendly interface, athletes can access detailed reports and velocity visualizations to gain insights into technique and progress.

The Aperto Terrier aims to help individuals, athletes, and researchers explore, innovate, and contribute to the advancement of athletic analysis.

- 18 variables, splits and stats and +150m of line
- Wrote UI, threaded application

A strong understanding of electronics is vital. This includes knowledge of circuit design, components like sensors, transistors, capacitors, and resistors, as well as digital electronics concepts such as microcontrollers and logic gates.

Knowing how to select, incorporate, and interpret data from sensors is critical in a telemetry device. This could include accelerometers, gyroscopes, or GPS modules for tracking movement and speed.

A sprinting telemetry device would likely involve an embedded system. Being able to program these systems, typically using languages like C or C++, is a crucial skill.

Raw data from sensors often needs to be processed and filtered to be useful. This requires an understanding of signal processing techniques.

Once the data is gathered, it needs to be analyzed and interpreted. This could involve statistical techniques, and even machine learning, depending on the complexity of the device.

Given that the device is likely to be portable, understanding how to manage power consumption for optimal battery life is an important skill.

The device needs to be designed to be durable, lightweight, and comfortable for the user. This involves knowledge of materials, ergonomics, and design principles.

For data visualization or interfacing with the device, a software application might be needed. This could involve coding in languages such as Python or Java, and knowledge of user interface and user experience design.

Rapid prototyping skills such as using a breadboard for electronic components or 3D printing for casing can speed up the development process. In addition, being able to thoroughly test and debug both hardware and software is a key skill.

#### Results/Professional Interest:
- After posting a prototype online I was invited (on my own dime) to Nairobi Kenya, to visit Ferdinand Omanyala. I went.
- I flew by myself to the 2022 Track and Field World Championships in Eugene, Oregon a week early to ask international coaches and fans for feedback.
- I went to Oberlin College in October 2022 to test updated designs and software with a coach I met in Eugene, Oregon. -->

#### General Design
<img src="/media/Terrier-Media/Top-Down.PNG" style="max-width: 400px; float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
I began this project selecting off-the-shelf parts, trying to quickly prototype something viable. The key objective at first was to prove the concept that the device could accurately measure and record sprinting statistics.

Once a basic setup was working, I began redesigning the internal parts and mechanisms from the ground-up. I separated the design into a few "modules" including modules for the: line spool, level-wind mechanism and an encoder spool. These components were 3D printed and mounted inside an aluminum project box.

The line spool has integrated a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor to provide drag for backlash of 80lb braided kevlar line that is tied to a user.

The level-wind mechanism is a module with a servo, rack and pinion, that serves to maintain a level line as the BLDC motor reels back in the line.

The encoder spool has an AMT-102-V encoder that acquires all position data of athletes unspooling the line.

I applied concepts from drag, backlash, dimensioning and tolerancing, machine design, DFA/DFM, material science and physics to iterate to a mechanical design and part selection that worked.

#### Embedded Software Development 

To add functionality to the parts, specifically the encoder, motor and servo, I wrote an Arduio program for an ESP32 to control the logic flow of the device. This enabled the acquisition of rotation point readings, stall detection, and managing the level wind mechanism's oscillation on rewind.

#### Python Software Development

To interface with the ESP32 and store all the data, I wrote a Python program with a UI to send commands via USB because I found there wasn't a faster (and more easy to implement) method to transfer encoder data. In the Python program I used statistical analysis to process the raw encoder readings, visualize velocity sprinting stats, and organize athletes. More specifically, I enabled creation of athlete-specific folders for data organization, and reduced user friction through QR code recognition for wristbands (instead of repeatedly typing in user information).

            Early in development, I shared my work online, which led to an invitation to visit Ferdinand Omanyala--Africa's Fastest Man--in Nairobi, Kenya. Embracing this opportunity, I demo'd my prototype and gained valuable feedback from a new culture's perspective.

Similarly, I visited the 2022 Track and Field World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, and gained valuable feedback from international coaches and fans.
<br><br>
In October 2022, I took the Terrier to Oberlin College to test updated designs and software with Ben Wach, a coach I had previously met in Oregon.
<br><br>
Most recently, students from Cornell University's Track Team have started a similar project. I have been giving them resources to engineer an upgraded version.
