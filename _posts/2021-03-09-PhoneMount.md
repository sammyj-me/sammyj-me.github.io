I began conceptualizing this project in October 2020. I was able to finally print my design after recieving my 3D printer in March of 2021.

I take a lot of video of myself to review my progress within athletic activities, and it's not always convenient bringing a tripod to the pool or track or the gym, 
mostly because it's big and bulky. Even imagine cruising for a mile to the skate spot with a 1.5' long tripod...it's just not ideal.

It's also not very convenient asking strangers to film you every 3 minutes or so. 

I decided to eliminate the bulk of a tripod (and social interaction) by designing a smaller "quad-pod" that stands on it's own and can be clamped to anything that fits within the C-clamp inspired vice.

Early Design Sketches:

This design is especially helpful in pool settings, where large open space reduce 
effectiveness of the "tripod setting", but many overhanging beams and bleachers allow 
for much more versatile phone-camera-angles than if you just had a tall tripod.


Tension to the clamp is applied via rubber bands (2-3 small orthodontic rubber bands per hook work great).

I also added hooks to the main body to allow the user to lash or hang the mount to virtually anything.

Multiple screw-attachments on the main body allow for adjustment of the ball-mount on for easy phone-angle positioning.
