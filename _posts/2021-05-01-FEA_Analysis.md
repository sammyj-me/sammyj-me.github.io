### About

<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        My senior design project at the University of Saint Thomas was in collaboration with Emerson Electric's assembly line. My role was to utilize ANSYS software for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to enhance the design of a crimping tool. This was a great experience for me to iterate mechanical designs, something that has fascinated me since realizing the expenses involved in mechanical system manufacturing processes.

### Procedure

#### Understanding Background:
<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        The first stage required an understanding of the project's background. We analyzed a briefing document about the problem and defined the needs of the product.
    </p>
</div>

#### Defining Needs:
<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        • Crimper shall be able to crimp 
        fill tubes made of two different 
        metals.
        <br>• Redesign must have a physical 
        width reduction at the crimping 
        end of the device of 30% to 40% 
        when compared to the current 
        crimper. 
        <br>• Crimper must utilize an 80-100 psi 
        air supply.
        <br>• Must be ergonomic for all 
        operators.
        <br>• Shall have a fatigue life of greater 
        than 1,000,000 cycles.
    </p>

#### Design Process:
<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        These needs formed the basis upon which we would iterate designs as we started the design process. As my team members proposed designs, I applied motion analysis in SolidWorks and simulated designs in ANSYS software to verify clearance of certan part geometries and simulate strength of each design by measuring resulting forces. Design feedback would usually come through showing an array of simulation results, concluding in suggestions to add material thickness in areas where the simulated tool showed weakness.

#### Emperical Testing:
<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        The third stage involved empirical testing of the physical force required to crimp tubes. We utilized an MTS machine for this testing process, which provided us with data to cross reference forces calculated with formulas and with the ANSYS simulation.
    </p>
</div>
#### Final Design Review:
<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        Once our design had been thoroughly tested and adjusted, we moved on to the fourth stage. This involved creating a Bill of Materials (BOM) and conducting a final review of our design against the initial requirements.
    </p>
</div>
#### Manufacturing and Building:     <img src="/media/assembled-crimper.PNG" style="max-width: 400px; float: right; margin-left: 10px">
<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>
        With our design finalized and approved, we proceeded to the fifth and final stage: manufacturing and building the crimping tool. This stage sending our part drawings and BOM to a local manufacturer to be heat treated, machined, and assembled.

<!-- The details of the procedure is classified, the following will be a high-level overview of the steps we took to create this crimping tool.

Given Background of sponsor and user needs, we researched relevant technologies and applied relevant standards to create requirements for our crimper design.

There were a variety of designs we iterated through, coming up with a few designs before vetting them with motion analysis and ANSYS.

We tested physical force required to crimp tubes with an MTS machine.

After settling on a design, we created a BOM, verified our requirements, and manufactured and built our crimping tool. -->
