    <h2>My backstory</h2>
    <p>Early exposure to technology</p>
    <p>evolutionary passion to engineering</p>
    <p>Being Psych minded</p>
    <p>Realizing I'm in a position with my current mindset and knowledgebase that will allow me to help a lot of people and promote social change.
    <p>I am quick to pick up skills and I tend to analyze my history of activity to explain any carry over. I'm not afraid to get out of my comfort zone when it comes to meeting new people or taking on new projects.</p>

    <h2>A few goals for my 20s</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Do stuff.</strong> Less talk, more brainstorm --> do stuff.
        <p>I spend a lot of time in front of a screen and now I'm ready to touch some grass and talk to people about how much time I used to spend in front of a screen!</p>
     <p>
        <strong>Travel More.</strong> As I plan to "do stuff", I want to travel the world and fulfill my own "Eat Pray Love" divorce fantasies.
    <!--
    <p>
        <strong>Become better at putting myself out there.</strong> I have always struggled with talking about myself and my interests with other people, and this has led to a few
        less-than fulfilling friendships. <p>This website is a big step for me in taking action to muddle through to my goal of <strong>"putting myself out there"</strong> with the idea that the energy I put out to the world is the energy that I will receive back.
        <p>A little experiment on the ol' platitude if you would.</p>
        <p>It's almost counter culture within my social group in this day and age (as of 6/30/2021) to post <strong>more</strong> on the internet. What I fear is coming across as self-centered,
        but I think with the right intent <strong>and</strong> content (making sure there isn't a disconnect between good intentions and "bad" actions), one can project an "authentic self" that others can connect with on social media. Whatever "authentic" means anyway. Posting more on social
        media isn't the end-all-be-all for this goal, but it is a step forward in getting me used to talking about myself in a "public setting."</p>
     <p>
        <strong>Travel More.</strong> I spend a lot of time on the internet taking peeks into other peoples' lives, and with true independence right around the corner, I will now have the opportunity to bridge
         the gap between imaginative lands, tastes, and human perspectives into visceral ones. One thought I always go back to is that there's always something to say about experiencing things in person vs. from experiencing it second hand. The contextual backdrop of getting in your car,
         boarding a plane, and having your senses stimulated by the new sights and sounds arguably provides a more "real" experience than just reading about it. From travelling in my 20s, I hope to learn to internalize the beauty of the present moment, with complete awareness of my senses, just a little bit more.

            <h3>Header 3</h3>
            <p>I recently upgraded to the <strong>Canon EOS R</strong>, a full-frame mirrorless camera, after using my trusty Canon Rebel T5i for over seven years. I shoot with the <strong>RF 24-105mm f/4L</strong>, an <strong>RF 35mm f/1.8 </strong> prime, and on occasion, the <strong>EF 50mm f/1.8</strong>.</p>
            <p>I edit my photos with <strong>Adobe Lightroom Classic CC</strong>. I'll switch to the cloud version when it reaches feature parity and once storage gets cheaper.</p>
