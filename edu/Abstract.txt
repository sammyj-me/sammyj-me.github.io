The goal of this research is to document how velocity of an effervescent jet is affected by distance, bubble size and gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) in the jet.


An open source MATLAB program was used to analyze the particle pattern of a jet flow.

The effervescent jet injected air perpendicular to the liquid flow, allowing for the manipulation of the GLR and bubble sizes.

High-speed video was captured of different GLRs ranging from 0.0006 to 0.0023, and bubble diameters of 0.258(mm) and 1.748(mm).

Individual frames from the high-speed video were imported into a MATLAB based PIV program.

Vector analysis was performed on a frame-by-frame basis on lines that spanned the jet flow three, five, and seven diameters (of the jet nozzle) away from the jet nozzle.

Radial and axial velocity vector data at each diameter was imported into Microsoft Excel and further data analysis was performed.

Histograms containing percent frequencies and bins for selected u and v velocities were created in excel.

•	instead of finding supporting evidence we are documenting how velocity distribution downstream of an effervescent jet is affected by distance, bubble size and gas to liquid ratio in the jet
•	I would define what an effervescent jet is early in the abstract (mixture of bubbles and liquid)
•	Instead of GLR call it the gas to liquid ration
•	Give a couple of specific numbers - like GLR range and bubble size range
