    <ul class="list-arrows">
        <li>Worked at <strong></strong>SUBC Inc</strong>, creating <a href="/2021/06/29/PlateletThrombometer.html" target="_blank">a point-of-care device from scratch</a> to allow for easy platelet reactivity testing.</li>
        <li>Machined Parts at <a href="https://www.rochcnc.com/photos/" target="_blank"><strong>Rochester Precision Machine</strong></a> where I operated a variety of CNC Mills and Lathes, changing out tools, jumping to different parts of CNC programs and adjusting offsets as needed.</li>
        <li>Researched with <strong><a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/engineering/faculty/thomas-g-shepard.html">Professor Thomas Shepard</a></strong> on a project to document how 
        downstream velocity of an effervescent jet is affected by distance, bubble size and gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) injected into the jet.</li>
        <li>Researched with <strong><a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/engineering/faculty/thomas-g-shepard.html">Professor Thomas Shepard</a></strong> on the early development of a novel system to measure hull drag without a tow tank.</li>
        <li>Coached youth athletes with <strong><a href="https://www.teamunify.com/team/mnmcast/page/home">The Rochester Swim Club</a></strong>, where I helped make periodization-related training decisions and gave specific form cues to +80 athletes.</li>

        <h2>Education</h2        
        <p>The University of Saint Thomas holds pride in building a community of people who care about ethical leadership--Saint Thomas has helped me form a system of values and morals to help me begin to put into the perspective the kind of impact I can make on the world.</p> 
        <p>In May 2021, I completed a <strong>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering</strong>, where I found a lot of joy in slam poetry. Here is one of the most intellectually stimulating pieces outside of the engineering curiculum. I like to think about how the poetic devices here apply to my main field of study.</p>
